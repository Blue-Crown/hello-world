This is my learning repository

Hi everybody!

I'm an aspiring quantitative ecologist in the Seattle area of Washington state in the USA. My background is mainly in veterinary science, including biology, zoology, and ecology so I'm VERY new to this coding thing. However, I am excited to learn. I thought it would be boring...but I didn't realize coding is the epitome of organizing data in easily understandable and workable ways. It's like The Container Store for data, but with infinite different options of tupperware! And who doesn't like organizing and color coding and alphabetizing...or is it just me? Ha!
